# Automated-Attendance-System-Using-Facial-Recognition
Even today taking student attendance and maintaining a record is still a pretty tedious and time-consuming job. It is both wastage of resources as well as time.
Therefore we propose a solution to this problem by providing An automatic system for face recognition during a real time background for a school to mark the group attendance of their students by providing User-Friendly GUI .
The following modules would be implemented:
Add new Student. 
Training Module
Take Attendance
Create Monthly Attendance Excel Sheet of every subject.
Defaulterâ€™s Attendance List of every subject.
Calculate Attendance Marks of every subject.
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) would be simple and user-friendly.
